# Introduction #

You can upload a route to a garmin device from the [AR - Routes](ARRoutes.md) view.

# Details #

You will need to install the [Garmin Communicator Plugin](http://www8.garmin.com/support/download_details.jsp?id=3607). Then:

  * Select your activity, go to "Edit Activity -> AR - Send One activity to Routes View".
  * Make sure you have a google map/google earth selected (top right hand corner).
  * Click the white "plus" sign on a blue background that is top center of the screen (not the one at bottom right).
  * A list of your activities will appear (probably just the one at this point). Click on the row (**not** the checkbox) to select it (it turns blue). Now click the "Export>" link.
  * You now have a garmin communicator "Export Course" dialog on screen.
  * Click Find devices to let it attach to your device, then "Write" to send the workout(s) to your device.
  * Note that you can edit the time, and the name, before sending it. If you edit the time, it will scale the pace on the track (rather than just setting it to a constant pace, as ST does).
