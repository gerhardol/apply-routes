# Introduction #

Use this option to join multiple workouts.

# Details #

Select the workouts to be joined, and select "AR - Join workouts".

To select multiple activities, you can either select them by ctrl-clicking (only in Reports view for ST2), or, to join all the activities on a single day, click on the row for that day in the daily activities view.

ST3 Note: The join functionality is included in the latest ST3 version. This option must be manually enabled in Settings.

ST2 **IMPORTANT**: Due to an ST limitation, the time from the start of the first workout to the end of the last workout must be less than 18 hours (this limitation does not apply to ST3).
[Apply Routes](http://sporttracks.myosotissp.com/applyroutesplugin.html) will not join workouts that exceed this limit.
